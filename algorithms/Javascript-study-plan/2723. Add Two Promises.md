# **2723. Add Two Promises**


## **Problem Statement**

You’re given two promises, `promise1` and `promise2`.
Both will eventually resolve to numbers.
You need to return a *new promise* that resolves to the **sum** of those two numbers.

Simple. But people still manage to complicate it.

---

## **Concepts Used**

### **1. What a Promise Actually Is**

A promise is just an object that *represents a value that you don’t have yet*.
It’s like a friend telling you “I’ll send you the answer later.”
Except unlike you, JavaScript’s friend actually delivers.

### **2. `Promise.all`**

This method takes an array of promises and returns a new promise that resolves when *all of them* are done.

Inside, it basically waits for every promise to finish, collects their resolved values in an array, and gives them back to you in order.

### **3. `async` / `await`**

Sugar coating on top of promises.
Behind the scenes, `await` just pauses the function until the promise resolves.

No time travel. No magic. Just syntactic chill.

---

## **Approach**

There are two clean ways to solve this problem:

### **Approach 1: Using `Promise.all()`**

You pass the two promises together, wait for them both, and sum the resolved values.

This approach is good when:

* You want both promises to start immediately.
* You want to handle them in parallel.
* You write code like a sane human.

### **Approach 2: Using `await`**

You wait for each promise individually, then add the results.

Clear, readable, and sometimes easier when there’s more logic.

Both do the same thing under the hood — grabbing values from asynchronous operations.

## **Your Code (Cleaned Up)**

### **Using `Promise.all()`**

```javascript
/**
 * @param {Promise} promise1
 * @param {Promise} promise2
 * @return {Promise}
 */
var addTwoPromises = async function(promise1, promise2) {
    return Promise.all([promise1, promise2])
        .then(values => values[0] + values[1]);
};
```

### **Using `async/await`**

```javascript
var addTwoPromises = async function(promise1, promise2) {
    const value1 = await promise1;
    const value2 = await promise2;
    return value1 + value2;
};
```

Both will output:

```javascript
addTwoPromises(Promise.resolve(2), Promise.resolve(2))
  .then(console.log); // 4
```
